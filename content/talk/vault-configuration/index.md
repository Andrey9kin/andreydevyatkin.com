abstract: |
    Hippo Technologies uses the Vault provider for Terraform. Every month, new features and capabilities are added to the provider, allowing them to improve their Vault configuration management continuously. In this talk, Andrey will share Hippo's journey, from the first, basic, steps of Terraforming Vault, to where they are now. He'll delve into what went well, what didn't work, and what you should consider before you embark on this journey, like incorporating DevSecOps.
